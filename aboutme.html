            <p>Iâ€™m a Web Developer/Designer (in progress) currently studying computer science in Ireland.
                The purpose of this website is to allow you to get to know me better.<br/>
            </p>
            <p>Julio is 20 years old and from Brazil. That's it. Just kidding.<br/> One of my main hobbies
            are listening to music, my favorite artists are Poppy, Linkin Park and Grimes, but I still
            consider myself an eclectic person even though heavier music is my jam. Listening to music is
            usually what inspires me to create and sets the mood for my creativity to fly high.<br/>
            </p>
            <p>I also enjoy creating art on my spare time, you can find a few that I have done on my
                Instagram page on the Contact Me section. I take inspiration from artists such as Jesse
                Draxler and Gekidan Inu Curry. I plan on one day having my own clothing shop with my art on 
                t-shirts as a side project.<br/>
            </p>
            <p>You can get to know more about my skills on my Curriculum page, and if you wish
                to contact me, there is a section for that as well! In the main time, enjoy this Spotify
                playlist with a few of my favorite songs.<br/><br/>
